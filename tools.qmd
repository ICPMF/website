## [Growth Predictor](https://skandamis.shinyapps.io/Microbial-Growth-Predictor-Dashboard/)

A predictive modelling and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) application in Rshiny. Primary model fitting is carried out with the Baranyi model. Secondary fitting and growth simulations are based on gamma models with or without interactions. A variety of gamma terms can be used under static or dynamic conditions. The variability in T, pH, aw, the levels of up to 6 inhibitors and the strain-to-strain variability in growth limits can be described by normal distributions. The QMRA is comprised of four consecutive modules from primary production till consumption, coupled with built-in, or user defined dose-response models. In addition to prevalence, the modules consider partition, mixing, cross-contamination and uncertainty in prevalence (beta distribution). Variability can be introduced through a variety of probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Pert, Triangular, Discrete, Uniform, etc.), for initial contamination, re-contamination, storage time and temperature, product characteristics, serving size, maximum population density, and cooking practices. Fixed or variable log reductions during cooking, may be introduced as user-defined values or probability distributions, respectively, or estimated by Bigelow thermal inactivation model. Suitable for assessing compliance with micro-criteria and relative risk ranking. 

## [MicroHibro](https://microhibro.com/)

The software includes a tool for assessing and designing sampling plan and derive risk metrics such as Food Safety Objectives and Performance Objectives.

## [Microrisk Lab](https://www.microrisklab.top/)

Microrisk Lab is an R-based online freeware for predictive microbiology, with its core function being the parameter estimation and model simulation of microbial behaviours such as growth and inactivation. The platform integrates up to 36 peer-reviewed mathematical models, covering primary models under static and non-isothermal conditions, secondary models describing the influence of environmental factors on specific growth rates, and competitive growth models for two microflora populations, supporting both deterministic and stochastic simulations. 

## [MRV - Microbial Responses Viewer](http://mrviewer.info/)

Microbial Responses Viewer is a growth/no growth interface based on ComBase database. It provides a visualisation of growth/no growth plot with the specific growth rates as a function of temperature, pH, and aw.  The MRV enables users to retrieve microbial growth/no growth information intuitively. Using the MRV, food processors can easily identify appropriate food design and processing conditions.
