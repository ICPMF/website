A collection of relevant predictive modelling tools and software (programming codes, spreadsheets, websites, etc.) is presented in this section, providing a concise description, access link, and files. If you do not find your software application or any other indispensable tools, please let us know, and send the information. The list will be updated as soon as possible.

## üî¨ [Pathogens In Foods](https://pif.esa.ipb.pt/)

[Pathogens-in-Foods is a database](https://pif.esa.ipb.pt/) of systematically formatted occurrence data of the most important biological hazards in foods randomly surveyed from European farms, processing facilities, retail establishments and restauration.

Under a harmonised arrangement, Pathogens-in-Foods brings together prevalence and enumeration data of pathogenic bacteria, parasites and viruses in foods, extracted from published peer-reviewed articles and reports.

## [MicroHibro](https://microhibro.com/)

An online toolbox to assess quantitatively the risk of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in a variety of food commodities, by including predictive models, dose-response models, stochastic models. The software includes a tool for assessing and designing sampling plan and derive risk metrics such as Food Safety Objectives and Performance Objectives.

## [Food Spoilage and Safety Predictor (FSSP)](http://fssp.food.dtu.dk/)

A standalone software for the prediction of the shelf-life and growth of bacteria in different fresh and lightly preserved meat, dairy and seafood products. It can be used also when the effect of product temperature profiles recorded over time by data loggers.

## [ComBase](https://combase.errc.ars.usda.gov/)

An online relational database of records that quantitatively describe the growth and inactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in food environments. The software also includes a suite of broth- and food-based models, as well as data-fitting tools. The initiative is a collaboration between the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service.


## [Sym'Previus](http://symprevius.eu/en/)

A decision support software tool for predicting bacterial growth, growth/no growth boundaries and thermal inactivation. It also contains microbiological data-fitting tools. The software makes it possible to take into account variability inherent to food products, processes and micro-organisms.

## [FDA-iRISK](https://www.foodrisk.org/resources/display/2)

An interactive, web-based risk assessment tool developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to inform prioritization and intervention decisions about food safety. Through built-in functions and automated features, FDA-iRISK enables users to rank risks from multiple microbial and chemical hazards more efficiently, as well as predicting the effectiveness of potential solutions.
